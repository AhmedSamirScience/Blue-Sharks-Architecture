/**
 * ðŸ§  ViewModel for BasicVMFragment â€” Demonstrates ViewModel + StateFlow integration
 *
 * âœ… Purpose:
 * This ViewModel is used to manage and expose a simple counter state using Kotlin's `StateFlow`.
 * It demonstrates a unidirectional data flow from ViewModel â†’ UI, and is designed to survive
 * configuration changes while maintaining the latest state.
 *
 * âœ… Key Features:
 * - Holds a mutable counter value that is exposed as an immutable `StateFlow`
 * - Provides a public `increment()` method to update the counter
 * - Safe to collect from Fragments using lifecycle-aware constructs like `repeatOnLifecycle`
 *
 * âœ… Usage Scenario:
 * Ideal for demonstrating:
 * - How `StateFlow` works inside a ViewModel
 * - How Fragments collect updates safely
 * - How state survives rotation and configuration changes
 *
 * ðŸ§ª Example Usage (in Fragment):
 * ```kotlin
 * lifecycleScope.launch {
 *     viewLifecycleOwner.repeatOnLifecycle(Lifecycle.State.STARTED) {
 *         viewModel.counter.collect { count ->
 *             textView.text = "Counter: $count"
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
